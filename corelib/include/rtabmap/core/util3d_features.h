/**
 * @brief Projects 2D keypoints to 3D space using the provided depth image and camera models.
 * 
 * This function takes a vector of 2D keypoints and projects them into 3D space by using 
 * depth values from a depth image and the associated camera models. It supports multi-camera setups 
 * by assuming the depth image is horizontally stacked with sub-images corresponding to each camera.
 * 
 * If a depth value at a keypoint location is invalid or outside the specified depth range 
 * (`minDepth`, `maxDepth`), the output 3D point will be set to NaN.
 * 
 * @param keypoints      A vector of 2D keypoints (in image coordinates).
 * @param depth          The depth image (must be either `CV_32FC1` or `CV_16UC1`). 
 *                       For multiple cameras, the depth images should be horizontally concatenated.
 * @param cameraModels   A vector of camera models, one per camera. Each model must provide intrinsic
 *                       parameters and optionally a local transform to apply to the resulting 3D point.
 * @param minDepth       Minimum valid depth value. If negative, no minimum is enforced.
 * @param maxDepth       Maximum valid depth value. If zero or negative, no maximum is enforced.
 * 
 * @return A vector of 3D points (`cv::Point3f`) corresponding to the input keypoints. 
 *         If the depth is invalid or outside the valid range, the point will contain NaNs.
 * 
 * @throws Assertion failure if the depth image is empty or not of the expected type,
 *         or if the camera model vector is empty, or if camera index computation fails.

 * a validity mask and filters 3D points by depth range.
 *

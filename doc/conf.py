# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
## rosdoc2 will extend the extensions to enable Breathe and Exhale if you
## do not add them here, as well as others, perhaps.
## If you add them manually rosdoc2 may still try to configure them.
## See the rosdoc2_settings below for some options on avoiding that.
